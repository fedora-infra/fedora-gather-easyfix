The idea of this program is to gather tickets from different project
which are marked as 'easyfix' (or any other keyword for that matter).

This version is a simple proof of concept, eventually it should be
converted to an html page and this script run by a cron job of some sort.

The different project to suscribe by email or a git repo or a page on
the wiki. To be sorted out...
